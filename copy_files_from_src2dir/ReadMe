For example, we have 3 folders 
  - folder1 = contain some files from source directory
  - folder2 = source directory 
  - folder3 = destination directory
If some files in folder 1 match the files in source directory, and you want to copy those files from source directly to destination directory. 

This short and easy python code will help you to copy those files from folder one that already exist in second folder and transfer them to third folder.
